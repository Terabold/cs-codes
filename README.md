# Bagrut 2025 - C# Project: Queues, BinNodes, and Inheritance

This project includes multiple C# files focused on essential topics for the Bagrut 2025 exam: **Queues**, **BinNodes**, and **Inheritance**. The code demonstrates key concepts through various functions and includes a **Utils** class for validation and code checking.

---

## Project Structure

### Queues 📊:
Includes code for implementing and managing queue data structures with relevant functions.

### BinNodes 🌳:
Contains logic for binary nodes and binary tree operations, covering insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Inheritance 🧬:
Focuses on demonstrating inheritance in object-oriented programming, showing the relationship between base and derived classes.

## Key Concepts and Functions

### `Utils` Class 🛠️
The **Utils** class includes helper methods to:
- Validate the functionality of queues, binary nodes, and inheritance structures.
- Check the correctness of your implementations by testing edge cases and sample inputs.

## How to Run

1. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
2. Build the project to compile the code.
3. Execute the relevant functions or test cases to check the operations of each topic.
4. Use the **Utils** class to verify the correctness of your code.
